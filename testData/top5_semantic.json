You don't have to imagine it, you just described it to me. \n\nCurrent \"qt\" measures give the game away if you take the time to look at them. \"Demand is too high we have to cause a resession and unemployment by raising rates.\" What that means that we can't even get to peak demand before throwing people out of work. People can't start saving until after peak demand. Flat prices cause peak demand, high top marginal tax rates (read wealth caps) cause flat prices, why make money you can't keep.

Retrieved from https:\/\/scholarworks.umass.edu\/econ_workingpaper\/343\n\nExcerpt from the linked paper:^1\n\n>The dominant view of inflation holds that it is macroeconomic in origin and must always be tackled with macroeconomic tightening. \n\n>In contrast, we argue that the US COVID-19 inflation is predominantly a sellers\u2019 inflation that derives from microeconomic origins, namely the ability of firms with market power to hike prices. Such firms are price makers, but they only engage in price hikes if they expect their competitors to do the same. \n\n>This requires an implicit agreement which can be coordinated by sector-wide cost shocks and supply bottlenecks. \n\n>We review the long-standing literature on price-setting in concentrated markets and survey earnings calls and compile firm-level data to derive a three-stage heuristic of the inflationary process: \n\n>(1) Rising prices in systemically significant upstream sectors due to commodity market dynamics or bottlenecks create windfall profits and provide an impulse for further price hikes. \n\n>(2) To protect profit margins from rising costs, downstream sectors propagate, or in cases of temporary monopolies due to bottlenecks, amplify price pressures. \n\n>(3) Labor responds by trying to fend off real wage declines in the conflict stage. \n\n>We argue that such sellers\u2019 inflation generates a general price rise which may be transitory, but can also lead to self-sustaining inflationary spirals under certain conditions.\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>The sectors and companies we have discussed for the impulse stage are merely examples, but they illustrate how windfall profits were reaped following specific price hikes. \n\n>Exploding prices became exploding costs for other companies across the economy. Since the economy is a network of input-output relationships, there is no clear beginning or end to price hikes \u2013 e.g. steel matters for oil and oil for steel. \n\n>Nevertheless, some companies matter more for inflation than others, and we grouped them in the impulse stage insofar as they have seen large margin, profit and price increases, and rank highly in terms of the number of forward linkages.\n\n>There are also examples of upstream industries that acquired systemic significance during the period of inflation but displayed more of a propagation rather than an impulse pattern.\n\n>In [the case of CH Robinson and Home Depot] we see large price increases even when demand began falling as the pandemic boom ceased. This is consistent with the principle we laid out above: firms with market power price primarily to protect profits, not to induce demand (with the exception of promotions). \n\n>An even more extreme example of price increases in response to declining demand is Starbucks (Appendix Figure 18).\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>Some firms have managed to not only protect margins but increase them in varying degrees by raising prices, thus amplifying the overall inflation dynamic. \n\n>Procter and Gamble, for example, a producer of hygiene and health care products that enjoyed strong demand during 2020, managed to increase margins and profit volumes somewhat above the pre-pandemic level and to keep them there due to price increases when volume growth declined (Appendix Figure 17).\n\n>Simply put, selling goods that people depend on gives Procter and Gamble space to raise prices.\n\n>Sellers\u2019 inflation is not possible in a perfectly competitive economy, but in a highly concentrated economy in which large firms are price makers, it is a real possibility \u2013 as we are witnessing again today.\n\n>Large firms also tend to have more financing options beyond bank loans, which can make them generally less dependent on bank rates.\n\n^1 Sellers\u2019 inflation, profits and conflict: Why can large firms hike prices in an emergency?

From my perspective,  governments have outsourced inflation and recession policies to Central Banks. They are almost scared of spending money on stopping or fixing a recession. \nThis changed during the pandemic when Central Banks had run out of levers to keep the economy afloat"},{"CommentID":"jd4ze0a","CommentBody":"A part of me is really curious if he had an Oppenheimer moment as he looked on his creation that he'd created an instrument of destruction? \n\nI mean, as he points out, QE has been misused by the central banks with the coordinated effort starting in March 2020. But QE was going on for more than a decade prior, and the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet of more than 4 trillion by February 2020. \n\nQE has had disastrous effects for governments around the globe economically, socially, and even democratically as people largely reject institutions in trends in the last few years. It's led to massive economic inequality and insecurity, social stratification, and even a rejection of democratic principles.\n\nEdit: also have to point out just how pernicious this is if true:\n\n>Apparently agreeing with my critique that pure fiscal policy does not result in economic growth unless it is backed by credit creation, Blackrock had argued at Jackson Hole that the \u201cnext downturn\u201d would require central banks to create new money and find \u201cways to get central bank money directly in the hands of public and private sector spenders\u201d \u2013 what they called \u201cgoing direct\u201d, bypassing the retail banks. The Fed knew this would create inflation, as Blackrock later confirmed in a paper which stated that \u201cthe Fed is now committing to push inflation above target for some time\u201d.\n\n>This is precisely what was implemented in March 2020. We know this both from available data and because the Fed, largely without precedent, hired a private-sector firm to help it buy assets \u2013 none other than Blackrock."},{"CommentID":"jd5palb","CommentBody":"> In other words, the \u201cumpires of the game\u201d are preparing to step into the arena and offer current accounts to the general public, competing directly against the retail banks they are supposed to regulate \u2013 a clear conflict of interest\n\nThe bigger conflict of interest is allowing the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks to be selected by private banks they are supposed to be regulating, and allowing them to trade on financial markets using knowledge of future interventions without being prosecuted for insider trading. We need regional central bank presidents to be democratically appointed and banned from private trading. With regards to SVB its CEO was on the board of directors for the San Francisco Fed which was supposedly overseeing them. \n\n> could be left with a Soviet-style monobank system, where the only bank in town is the central bank. This would be disastrous: the useful functions of retail banks are to create the money supply and allocate it efficiently via thousands of loan officers on the ground across the country.\n\nIt is possible for publicly owned central bank to create credit through local loan offices. In the early United States, the local land loan office system was advocated by Benjamin Franklin to create liquidity for farmers and immigrants. Franklin actually proposed King George create a loan office system where all interest on mortgages was centrally paid to the crown, to be then be paid back to the colonists through colonial infrastructure and the expenses of the British Empire in America, as an alternative to levying stamp taxes on the colonists. He thought this would be a suitable way to avoid the Revolutionary War but his proposal was rejected by the King's advisors.\n\nThe advantage to creating credit through a public banking system to directly compete with private banks is that the interest payments are collected as revenue and can be continuously spent back into circulation on socially necessary expenses without introducing any regressive taxes or causing debt deflation in the real economy. Adam Smith admitted in Wealth of Nations public collection of interest was sufficient to finance much of the budget of the colony of Pennsylvania.\n\nIt's not clear the Soviet comparison applies? In the Soviet Union the major businesses presumably did not directly own the capital or working inventory, and the state was not earning revenue from interest, so there is nothing for lenders to lend against or motive to lend.\n\n> Our empirical study of the US banking sector showed that big banks don\u2019t want to lend to small firms. However, most employment in the economy is with SMEs, which our study suggests will only thrive if we have a decentralised banking system with many small, local banks. In Germany, these local community banks have survived for more than 200 years because they use the co-operative voting system of one shareholder one vote. That system of \u201ceconomic democracy\u201d prevents takeovers\n\nFor public banking ideally the public interest revenue would be split between local, regional, and federal budgets based on the location of the borrower rather than all paid to the federal government, but if the goal is economic democracy it's not clear why relying only on private cooperatives is the ideal. If there's still a central bank lending to local co-operatives there's still a bankers bank which may be lending to non-cooperatives as well."},{"CommentID":"jd6ttui","CommentBody":"He\u2019s right.

It exacerbated inequality without increasing the velocity of money, consumption or encouraging more lending. What actually happened was that in the short term the extra money was simply hoarded, which makes sense considering QE was decreasing bank interest margins by cratering treasury yields.\n\nQE was an emergency measure that should have been used then abandoned as quickly as possible.

Deficits are basically credit creation and new purchasing power. The liability on a govs balance sheet never really has to be paid back. But not doing so means other ways of paying it back happen(inflation being the main one)\n\nThere is an argument that the feds form of QE was basically a pointless exercise since it was the classic pushing on a string issue at best and many say swapping out liquid bonds for reserves was just an asset swap, potentially even worse because their is no market for reserves or rehypothication. \n\nWhile I do agree with Werner in many points i can't actually say that central banks buying non financial sector assets boosted credit creation that drastically since from my understanding the central banks didn't actually go into the real economy to buy up stuff and set prices.
