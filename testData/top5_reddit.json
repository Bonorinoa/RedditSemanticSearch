Any guesses on what will cause the next cycle to start?","This is some very, very surface level, \"squint until you can see it\" comparison based on an incomplete picture. \n\nThe US economy had been largely subsistence based, with the exception of slave-powered plantations, from colonial times until well into the end of the 19th century. Devastating the economy of the South in the 1860s meant that by the turn of the 20th century, things were only just getting stabilized again. Geographic isolation from WWI propelled the 1920's economic boom while the rest of the world languished in a recession that would eventually pile up into the Great Depression and lead to WWII. \n\nThis whole \"cyclical century\" idea seems to ignore the first 20 years of the 21st century revolving around depleting the US economy in Iraq and Afghanistan, as opposed to isolation. Globalism and offshoring seems to be cooling a touch, but the US manufacturing sector has been a specter of what it once was. For example, the prestige economy relied on relative good pay for jobs where cost of living was low, in industries that fed each other in a somewhat boundless environment. Very few markets for consumer products had been saturated - in fact, creating new products grew at such a pace that we saw exponential growth just as new waves of things to make kept coming and coming. \n\nSure, you have some steps in common, but considering the impact that supply chain slowdowns have had on inflation globally, it's hard to see parallels between the 20th and 21st century without some real effort to shoehorn data on one or the other.","Author is a little meandering and vague, but this article seems to be trying to argue that some false \u201cprestige\u201d (money?) including resume and education is replacing skills and accomplishments as a metric for someone's likely ability to perform in a role or accomplish in the future.  It doesn\u2019t make the case at all that those things don\u2019t measure skills and accomplishment - which is what they exist for. \n\nThen it argues that money and \"brand\" are unreliable proxies or \"prestige\". This doesn't make sense as education and training credentials and experience (resume), which is what most employers go by, aren\u2019t \u201cmoney\u201d. Employers will try to learn what you've previously earned, but usually to see what they'll have to pay you not to understand how capable you are.\n\nIf anything reading between the lines, it feels like to the blogger that maybe these measures are too accurate and they'd like to avoid being as accountable as they make you, and would rather \"opt out\" and be a bartering digital nomad maker.\n\nSure there's the exception of the billionaire worshippers, which goes back to the Robber Barons.  In practice most of the time I don\u2019t think \u201chow much money you have\u201d is currently how anyone primarily measures skill and accomplishment or potential with a specific task or role - that would be extremely unreliable (I need someone to develop a sophisticated Java application - how much money do you have?). It correlates with success but is just one thing that influences perception.\n\n\nAs for the OP question - just not seeing it in the US. \n\nPoverty rates are at historic lows.\n\nMedian incomes are at historic highs even adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe biggest change is that there are a minority of very wealthy people enjoying most of the benefits of technology driven productivity increases in recent decades. I see this is a problem to solve.","The US has never once been a subsistence economy and even in the 1930s was by far the world\u2019s largest economy. Author has no idea what he\u2019s saying.","The USA was a major world exporter of nearly every textile and foodstuff from the 1980$ onward, and especially from 1900 onward.\n\nSo, this article doesn't even begin from a place of understanding. It then wanders into ideological nonsense and concludes with fallacies.","LOL. I think we have the lowest unemployment in 50 years and the highest standard of living in the history of the world. I think inflation is a little high because of tension with China, war in Ukraine and the after-effects of monetary intervention during a global pandemic.\n\nThe system needs a few years to re-organize and stabilize to respond to these things. Fortunately, capitalism is infinitely adaptable. We'll have a recession in the meantime, much overdue. \n\nWe'll be fine.","I try not to. In all seriousness, i think that innovation will drive an evolution where the powerful who already made their millions can make more. The political system is flawed, and a protectionalist state exists to inhibit creative destruction. For this reason I think the economy will be slow to evolve, but you can think of the sloth as greed.","I highly doubt it will get back to subsistence similar to the 1920s simply because our understanding of technology will allow us to get back on our feet get quicker. \n\nUnless\u2026.\n\nThe economic collapse caused civil unrest that finally kinda caused that dam to burst and creating a sort of mild civil war while we figure out how to restructure society. Then subsistence might be back on the table.","Yes. It seems we are headed full speed through a recession and straight into a depression. The same people who ran the market into the ground are still running the market now. They are literally betting against America in the greatest casino ever built. Mad Max here we come.","I think we're on the cusp of another giant economic expansion given the exciting technologies emerging.\n\nGoldman Sachs forecasts the metaverse market will be worth $8 trillion globally within two decades. Citi sees the metaverse reaching a staggering $13 trillion this decade. Morgan Stanley forecasts it exploding to $8 trillion just in China. Many professional services firms like Deloitte are forecasting similar numbers.\n\nWe're also at the very start of space, AI and quantum computing being commercialized, greening the economy and electrifying everything should also create lots of opportunity.\n\nPerhaps I'm overly optimistic but I tend to think we have some good days ahead.","To succeed in America you have to adapt to the modern era. You have to always be better and ahead than the curve. Because to be honest  performing \"average in America\" is bad. I wish it wasn't this stressful and competitive. But that's what's required.","This economy is solely terrible leadership. It is so bad, it feels intentional. Vote out what got us here and put competence back into leadership.","Looking at the graph here: https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US , I'm going to say no. Even with the 2008 crash and the Covid shutdown, the curve is remarkably smooth.","We are headed for harder times but it will play out differently in my view.  Ive enjoyed reading others opinions here and they are wide ranged, meaning nobody really knows how our future plays out.\n\nMy take.  Our ecomomy is far more financialized today than the 1930s.  People then couldnt buy anything because they had no money.  In our near future people will have plenty of money but still wont be able to buy anything.  The depression was a deflationary deleveraging period whereas today and into the future we will see more periods of inflationary deleveraging. Stagnant to negative growth, rapidly increasing prices, and much higher taxation.  Past excesses must be worked out of the system and this is the only path forward as debt levels are very high.  Government and corporate debt needs to be reduced and inflation is less painful to tptb than default.  Especially for government whose main goal is self preservation.\n\nI dont know what that looks like in the future but its unlikely it leads the US to an agriculture based economy.  I would like to see labor and productivity seen as more useful than capital which is where we are at today.  This has led to misallocation of resources and the creation of what i label as bullshit jobs.","Yes. Middle class was a temporary unintended consequence of WW2. The primary purpose of government should be to prevent society from reverting to feudalism.\n\nOur government is like a gambling addict who sells his tools to play. \n\nIf you can't somehow find the cash to buy a new car today and don't own a house (no mortgage), you are a landless peasant."],"1":["Hi all,\n\nA reminder that comments do need to be on-topic and engage with the article past the headline.

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4. Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to industries with higher recent productivity growth.

Workers will want to work and raise families here.  Businesses will want to do business here.","It\u2019s interesting. The debate between union and non union. I have always felt that we are a country free to assemble, so if people want to form a union, have at it. Then if a employer doesn\u2019t cave to their demands and hires other people that are willing then so be it. I have always felt gov should stay out of it unless people are violent. The only caveat I have to this are unions against government entities.  Bureaucratic non sense will over run the lives of government workers like teachers and firemen if they don\u2019t collectively Bargan, so there must be some law in place.","I\u2019m always amused with the pro\/con union debate.

Thus rather than the money leaving the State in the pockets of the parasite investor class it remains in circulation.","Working people will have more money and ability to spend it hence the economy will improve. Unlike the lies corporations and many in government have spread through the years.","A common tactic unions use now is to grandfather benefits and pay to senior members while new hires get screwed with much lower pay and benefits (especially pension).

Right to work states broke unions, causing your pay and benefits to go down .","It could mean a stable workforce that is able to fund schools and educate their communities so that the kids can take on the jobs and solve the problems of tomorrow, for one.  It can mean community and the growth of local small business, as middle class workers spend money and feel pride in their communities.  It means a company can bring its workers to a place where there is health care for women and opportunities for kids and young adults. \n\nI suppose it could also mean a STOP in the slide toward child labor (nice job, Arkansas), scrip and company towns that seem to be the goal of business yet again. \n\nI guess it means what America means to you\/-life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the greatest country on earth or maybe a more Mordor like experience where we are only here to not get in the way of record profits and to toil ti produce and consume at only the level allowed by the bosses.","It means stronger unions in Michigan.

Ask yourself why.","\"Right to Work\" laws are a misnamed set of capital-friendly measures designed to make it easier to exploit laborers.
